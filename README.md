# Automated-Diagnosis-Model-Using-Transfer-Learning

This is my first attempt at using transfer learning. The task at hand was to train a machine learning model on Kaggle's Pneumonia Data Set, to accurately predict if the patient has Pneumonia or not. 

In order to achieve this, I used InceptionV3 as the base model, and performed transfer learning with added layers, to improve performance.
